# 1. Overall Project Planning

## `https://github.com/flycse/meg310-project`

### Positive Aspects:
- **Comprehensive Planning:** The project has a dedicated `plans` directory with detailed documents covering various aspects of project management, from task lists and assignments to stakeholder management and feasibility analysis.
- **Structured Approach:** The use of numbered plans (e.g., `PLAN11`, `PLAN21`) suggests a systematic and organized approach to planning, making it easy to navigate and find specific information.
- **Clarity and Transparency:** The markdown files are easy to read and understand, which promotes transparency and alignment among team members.
- **Maturity:** The level of detail in the plans indicates a mature project management approach suitable for complex projects.

### Lacking Aspects:
- **Interconnectivity:** While the individual plans are detailed, a master document or a project charter that links all the plans together could provide a more holistic view of the project at a glance.
- **Accessibility:** Having multiple files might make it slightly harder for a newcomer to get a quick overview compared to a single-document approach.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Centralized Plan:** The project plan is consolidated into a single, comprehensive `README.md` file. This makes it highly accessible and easy for anyone to get a quick overview of the project's goals, scope, and timeline.
- **Clear Goal and Scope:** The document starts with a clear project goal and a well-defined scope (both in and out), which is crucial for setting expectations.
- **Practicality:** The single-document approach is practical and efficient for smaller teams and projects, as it reduces the overhead of managing multiple documents.

### Lacking Aspects:
- **Scalability:** While effective for its current scale, this single-file approach may become cumbersome and difficult to maintain as the project grows in complexity.
- **Depth of Detail:** The plan covers all the essential areas but lacks the depth seen in `flycse/meg310-project`, particularly in areas like risk management and stakeholder roles.
- **Traceability:** While the document mentions traceability as a goal, the plan itself doesn't explicitly link requirements to tasks or tests, which would enhance traceability.
