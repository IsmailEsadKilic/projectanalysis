# 2. Task Management and Execution

## `https://github.com/flycse/meg310-project`

### Positive Aspects:
- **Detailed Task List:** `plans/PLAN11_task_list.md` provides a clear and detailed list of all the tasks required to complete the project. Each task has a unique ID, a name, a description, and a status.
- **Clear Task Assignments:** `plans/PLAN12_task_assignments.md` clearly assigns each task to a team member and includes a deadline. This ensures accountability and helps in tracking progress.
- **Dependency Mapping:** `plans/PLAN23_plan_budget_schedule.md` includes a section on task dependencies, which is crucial for effective scheduling and resource management.

### Lacking Aspects:
- **Granularity of Tasks:** Some tasks, like "Backend and Mobile Development," are quite broad and could be broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
- **Static Tracking:** The task status is manually updated in a markdown file, which might not be as efficient as using a project management tool or GitHub Issues for real-time tracking.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** The `README.md` includes a WBS that breaks down the project into key features, providing a clear overview of the work to be done.
- **Timeline:** The timeline section provides a clear schedule for the development of each feature, which helps in tracking progress against deadlines.
- **Responsibility Matrix:** The matrix clearly assigns responsibility for each phase of the project to specific team members, ensuring accountability.

### Lacking Aspects:
- **Task-Level Detail:** The plan is feature-focused. It lacks a granular task list with individual statuses (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) for each feature, making it harder to track the day-to-day progress.
- **No Dependency Information:** The plan does not explicitly mention dependencies between tasks or features, which could lead to scheduling conflicts.
- **No Task IDs:** The absence of unique task IDs can make it difficult to reference specific tasks in discussions or other documents.
