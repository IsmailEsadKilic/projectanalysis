# 3. Project Governance and Stakeholder Management

## `https://github.com/flycse/meg310-project`

### Positive Aspects:
- **Clear Stakeholder Identification:** `plans/PLAN24_project_stakeholders.md` identifies all the key stakeholders, their roles, and their responsibilities. This is essential for effective communication and expectation management.
- **Defined Roles and Responsibilities:** The document clearly outlines who is responsible for what, which helps in decision-making and accountability.
- **Lifecycle Method:** `plans/PLAN21_project_approach.md` describes the hybrid project lifecycle method, which shows that the team has thought about the best way to deliver the project.

### Lacking Aspects:
- **Communication Plan:** While stakeholders are identified, a formal communication plan outlining how and when to communicate with each stakeholder is not explicitly mentioned.
- **External Stakeholders:** The plan could be more detailed about how external partners (e.g., API providers) will be managed.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Responsibility Matrix:** The responsibility matrix is a strong point, clearly defining who is responsible for the Backend, Frontend, Database, and Testing for each feature. This promotes clear ownership.
- **Team-Oriented Roles:** The roles are defined by function (Backend, Frontend, etc.), which is a practical approach for a small, focused team.

### Lacking Aspects:
- **No Stakeholder Analysis:** The plan does not include a broader stakeholder analysis. It focuses on the internal team but does not mention other stakeholders like end-users, product owners, or management.
- **Lack of Governance Model:** The plan does not specify the project's governance model, decision-making process, or meeting cadences.
- **No Communication Plan:** There is no mention of a communication plan, which could lead to inconsistencies in how information is shared among the team and with any external stakeholders.
