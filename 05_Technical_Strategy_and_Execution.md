# 5. Technical Strategy and Execution

## `https://github.com/flycse/meg310-project`

### Positive Aspects:
- **Clear Technical Vision:** The planning documents provide a clear vision of the technical aspects of the project, including the technology stack (Django, Flutter, Redis, PostgreSQL), and the overall architecture.
- **Skills Assessment:** `plans/PLAN22_plan_knowledge_skills.md` includes a detailed assessment of the required skills, the individual skills of the team members, and any missing skills. This is crucial for resource planning and training.
- **Transition to Operations:** `plans/PLAN25_transition_to_operations.md` outlines the plan for handing over the system to operations, including service level agreements (SLAs).

### Lacking Aspects:
- **Detailed Architecture:** While the technology stack is mentioned, a more detailed architectural diagram would be beneficial for developers to understand the system's components and their interactions.
- **Coding Standards:** The plans do not mention any coding standards or guidelines, which are important for maintaining code quality and consistency.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Defined Tech Stack:** The "Tools and Technologies" section clearly specifies the use of Django and PostgreSQL, which provides clear technical direction for the team.
- **MVP Definition:** The `README.md` includes a well-defined Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which is a great way to focus the development effort on the most critical features first.
- **Scope Definition:** The clear "In Scope" and "Out of Scope" sections help to prevent scope creep and keep the technical development focused.

### Lacking Aspects:
- **No Architectural Details:** The plan lacks any information about the software architecture, design patterns, or how the different parts of the system will interact.
- **No Plan for Non-Functional Requirements:** The plan focuses on features but does not address non-functional requirements like performance, security, or scalability in detail.
- **No Transition Plan:** There is no mention of a plan for deployment, maintenance, or transitioning the project to a production environment.
