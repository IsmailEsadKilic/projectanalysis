# 4. Risk and Feasibility Analysis

## `https://github.com/flycse/meg310-project`

### Positive Aspects:
- **Proactive Risk Management:** `plans/PLAN28_project_review_commitments.md` includes a section on identified risks and their mitigation strategies. This shows that the team is thinking ahead and planning for potential problems.
- **Comprehensive Feasibility Study:** `plans/PLAN26_project_feasibility_resource_leveling.md` provides a summary of the project's feasibility from technical, legal, and operational perspectives.
- **Resource Leveling:** The plan also includes resource leveling actions to address potential resource-related issues.

### Lacking Aspects:
- **Quantitative Risk Analysis:** The risk analysis is qualitative. A quantitative analysis, where risks are assigned a probability and impact score, could help in prioritizing the risks more effectively.
- **Risk Ownership:** The plan does not assign an owner to each risk, which could make it unclear who is responsible for monitoring and mitigating it.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Risk Identification:** The project plan includes a "Risks" section, which shows that the team has considered potential issues.

### Lacking Aspects:
- **Superficial Risk Analysis:** The risk analysis is very high-level, with only one identified risk ("Possible slow API response times."). This is likely insufficient for a real-world project.
- **No Mitigation Strategies:** The plan does not provide any mitigation strategies for the identified risk. A good risk plan should not only identify risks but also outline how to deal with them.
- **No Feasibility Analysis:** The `README.md` does not contain a feasibility analysis. This means there's no formal assessment of whether the project is technically achievable, financially viable, or operationally sustainable.
